## Project Goal
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the outcome of NBA games using boxscore stats from the past 10 seasons. In order to accomplish this, I:

* built a webscraper to gather the raw ddata
* process the data to prepare it for modeling
* evaluate and iterate upon the models to improve accuracy

## Stakeholder
The stakeholder for this project is Stat-Ball, a sports news and entertainment website. The site plans to have fantasy drafts and competitions for predicting NBA game winners, so they want to build an in-house model they can use as a benchmark for users to compete against. The exact limitations and specifications are discussed in the [Data Breakdown](#Data-Breakdown) section.
